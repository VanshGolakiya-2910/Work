# Vulnerability Scanner

A Python-based vulnerability scanner that checks for common security issues like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), missing security headers, and Directory Traversal vulnerabilities.

## Features

- **SQL Injection Detection:** Checks if the given URL is vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Detection:** Checks if the given URL is vulnerable to XSS attacks.
- **Security Headers Check:** Verifies the presence of important security headers.
- **Directory Traversal Detection:** Checks if the given URL is vulnerable to Directory Traversal attacks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vulnerability-scanner.git
   cd vulnerability-scanner
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

## Usage

1. Create a `VulnerabilityScanner` object by passing the target URL.

   ```python
   from vulnerability_scanner import VulnerabilityScanner

   target_url = "http://example.com/login"
   scanner = VulnerabilityScanner(target_url)
   ```

2. Run the scanner:

   ```python
   scanner.run_scanner()
   ```

## Example

```python
from vulnerability_scanner import VulnerabilityScanner

if __name__ == "__main__":
    target_url = "http://hkrb.hackxor.net/login"
    scanner = VulnerabilityScanner(target_url)
    scanner.run_scanner()
```

## How It Works

### SQL Injection Check

- Uses a list of common SQL Injection payloads.
- Sends requests with these payloads appended to the target URL.
- Checks if the response contains typical SQL error messages.

### XSS Check

- Uses a list of common XSS payloads.
- Sends requests with these payloads appended to the target URL.
- Checks if the payloads appear in the response, indicating possible XSS vulnerabilities.

### Security Headers Check

- Sends a request to the target URL.
- Checks for the presence of important security headers in the response.

### Directory Traversal Check

- Uses a list of common directory traversal payloads.
- Sends requests with these payloads appended to the target URL.
- Checks if the response indicates successful directory traversal.
